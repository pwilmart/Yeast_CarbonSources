# Yeast_CarbonSources
Yeast grown with galactose, glucose, or raffinose carbon sources from the Gygi lab labeled with 10-plex TMT reagents, in triplicate.

These are analyses of a public dataset (PRIDE [PXD002875](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002875)) from Paulo, O'Connell, Gaun, and Gygi:

> Paulo, J.A., Oâ€™Connell, J.D., Gaun, A. and Gygi, S.P., 2015. Proteome-wide quantitative multiplexed profiling of protein expression: carbon-source dependency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Molecular biology of the cell, 26(22), pp.4063-4074.

There were 24 RAW files of yeast grown in three different carbon sources. It was a 3x3 (9-plex) TMT experiment done with the SPS MS3 (MultiNotch) method on a Thermo Fusion instrument.

### R input table prep

Basic steps were similar for both pipelines:
1. flag proteins to exclude
  - common contaminants
  - decoys
  - proteins with no reporter ion signals
1. sort excluded proteins to bottom of table
1. make new tab
  - add column of protein accessions
  - add columns of the TMT channels
1. export the new tab contents to text files
  - table should be well-formed (single header line) and rectangular
1. read text file into R

Statistical test results in R are collected into a data frame in the same order as the imported proteins. At the end of the notebook, the results file is saved as a text file for adding back to the main protein results spreadsheet file.

Eventually, there needs to be a coherent, comprehensive summary file that contains the proteomics results, the statistical testing results, and any other information to aid biological interpretation (rich annotations, etc.). An Excel file is a good format for this since adding descriptive text and formatting are easy. A basic Excel sheet can be easily distributed in Supplemental files and opened in Open Office applications.
